NavMenu Nvim Script

A simple neovim script to create a navigation menu for quick access to frequently used files and directories.
Currently a WIP.

##  Current Issues:
- Issue with being able to create multiple navigators all on top of each other.

### Possible enhancements:
- Add previous location in order to return.
- Sort spacing and alignment.
- Add icons.
- Add customisation options -> color themes, keybindings, etc.
- Setup as github plugin
